Hey there! Welcome to cooking with C!

So this was a crazy shower idea had this morning (Apr 12, 2022) and it came from combining something I know kinda well (C programming) and something I don't know at all but would like to learn (cooking).

The idea of this whole project is to make a folder, which will hopefully develop into a library of some sorts, which contain recipes and programs that help you cook said recipes. I am praying that this will help me get better at coding and at the same time help you make little recipes for everyday use.

The first set of recipes I will focus on implementing will be desserts, and the very first will be a little complex in the hopes that it will be a good challenge: a strawberry shortcake. Let's see how this goes!

It went okay

Next up: Rice Krispies
 
okay im gonna make file that tells you how to makea recipe bc this is tedious and i forget steps
